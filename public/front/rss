The Iga ninjas are a dying breed as Toyotomis rule allows Japan to experience some peace. Juzo, an Iga ninja who had vowed revenge for the death of his family, is hired by a rich weapons merchant to assassinate Toyotomi, restarting his quest for blood. In his way are rival ninja, and his once best friend who has decided to become a government vassal. The main plot centers around the conflicts that confront Juzo. The largest of these is the conflict between Juzo and his oldest friend, Gohei. Then there is the conflict each of these characters has with their respective women, whom are also Ninja in their own right. Finally Juzo is faced with the ultimate conflict between duty and happiness. Can he complete his mission of assassinating Toyotomi? Or will he choose a life of happiness and fulfillment with his woman? There was a remake of this classic in 1999 entitled Owl's Castle, but for people that have seen both versions, this first version, Castle of Owls, stands as the penultimate adaptation of the classic Ryotaro Shiba novel "Ninja hicho fukuro no shiro".]]></description>

Now is the time for her to call everything into question: her nature, her body, her illness, and her sealed fate. Johan Anmuth is an 18th-century Prussian physician in perpetual conflict between the rise of rationalism and ancient forms of animism. The Book of Vision is a manuscript that sweeps these two existences up, blending them into a never-ending vortex. Far from a proper scientific text, the Book contains the hopes, fears, and dreams of more than 1800 patients. Dr. Anmuth truly knew how to listen to his patients whose spirits still wander through the pages, life and death merging in a continuous flow. The story of Anmuth and his patients inspire Eva to live her life to the fullest. Nothing expires in its time. Only what you desire is real, not merely what happens.]]></description>

Despite their geographic distance in Nicky now living in New York City, they will be spending both Thanksgiving and Christmas together on Nicky's return for the respective holidays. Those holidays end up not being as either envisioned. After her first husband Ryan abandoned her and their now fifteen year old son Anthony years ago, flower shop owner Simone will imminently be getting remarried, this time to high school classmate Jeremy Winters. While Simone is bracing herself for the arrival back of who she considers Jeremy's overbearing mother Miriam Winters for the holidays, she is ill-prepared for the feeling she has of being shut out of the bonding that is going on between Jeremy and Anthony, especially in wanting that precious time with her son before he goes away to college in three years. And what Nicky believes will be her short Thanksgiving stay in Marsden ends up being extended to Christmas upon news that her parents, Linda and Dave Beaton, are selling the family home, making this holiday season their last in that house. In helping her mother pack up the house, Nicky discovers among her old high school things a never seen Christmas card that was apparently secretly placed in one of her textbooks. The card is truly a love letter from the unknown writer who didn't sign his name. While Nicky is now a successful businesswoman operating her own consulting firm, she has many insecurities from her high school days, and thus goes on a quest, with help from her parents and Simone, to discover who her high school crush was in needing that affirmation that high school was not all bad. While she is focused on that past, she may miss what is currently right in front of her in the form of Derrick Marshall, her parents' real estate agent who is a bigger part of Nicky's past than she realizes. —Huggo]]></description>
